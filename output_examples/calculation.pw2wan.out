  Reading nscf_save data

     Reading xml data from directory:

     ./work/calculation.save/
     file Fe.pbe-spn-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF: wavefunction(s)  3P 3D renormalized
     file Se.pbe-dn-kjpaw_psl.1.0.0.UPF: wavefunction(s)  4S 4P 3D renormalized

     IMPORTANT: XC functional enforced from input :
     Exchange-correlation= PBE
                           (   1   4   3   4   0   0   0)
     Any further DFT definition will be discarded
     Please, verify this is what you really want
